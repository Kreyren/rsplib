A. FIRST STEPS

How to set up a simple test of the rsplib-2.3.0 release:

1. If, AND ONLY IF, you would like to use the sctplib/socketapi *userland* SCTP
   implementation, do the following two steps first:

 1.a. Get latest sctplib-****.tar.gz archive and install it by
      - Unpack the Tar/GZip archive
      - ./configure
      - make
      - make install
         (as root!)

 1.b. Get latest socketapi-****.tar.gz and install it by
      - Unpack the Tar/GZip archive
      - ./configure
      - make
      - make install
         (as root!)

2. Get latest rsplib-****.tar.gz and install it by
      - Unpack the Tar/GZip archive
      - If, AND ONLY IF, you would like to use *kernel* SCTP, do:
         ./configure --enable-kernel-sctp
        OTHERWISE (i.e. sctplib/socketapi userland implementation):
         ./configure
      - make
      - make install
         (Only necessary if you want an installation; as root!)

      Optional "configure" Parameters:
      --enable-qt: Enables Qt usage; this is necessary for the Fractal Generator
                   client! Without Qt, the client's compilation will be skipped.
                   The ./configure script expects the environment variable QTDIR
                   set to the Qt directory. You may need to set it appropriately,
                   e.g. "export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt3" for Ubuntu Linux!
                   This settings depends on your distribution; use
                   "locate qwidget.h" to find out the directory!
      --disable-qt: Disables Qt usage; the Fractal Generator client will *not*
                    be available. (DEFAULT)

      --enable-maintainer-mode: Enable the creation of debug symbols (-g) and turn
                                off compiler optimization. Necessary for debugging,
                                but makes programs much larger and slower. (DEFAULT)
      --disable-maintainer-mode: Disables maintainer mode. The code will be optimized
                                 and without debugging symbols. Node: Please turn on
                                 the maintainer mode if you discover any problems and
                                 report bugs to us!

      --enable-hsmgtverify: Enable Handlespace Management verification. This is
                            useful for debugging only (makes the PR slow!)
      --disable-hsmgtverify: Turns off Handlespace Management verification. (DEFAULT)

      --enable-csp: Enable the Component Status Protocol support (strongly recommended!)
                    (DEFAULT)
      --disable-csp: Turns the Component Status Protocol support off.

3. Ensure that multicast is working!
   - You need a configured network interface with:
        + at least a private address (192.168.x.y; 10.a.b.c; 172.16.n.m - 172.31.i.j)
        + having the multicast flag set (e.g. "ifconfig <dev> multicast")
     even if you want to make tests only via loopback! Multicast-announces do not
     work correctly otherwise!
     If you have a dummy device, configure it appropriately:
     root# ifconfig dummy0 10.255.255.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.255.255.255 up multicast
   - Ensure that your firewall settings for the ethernet interface allow
     UDP packets to/from the registrar (ASAP Announce/ENRP Presence) as well
     as ASAP/ENRP traffic over SCTP.

4. Start at least one registrar
   ./registrar-example
   (You can start multiple registrars; they may also run on different hosts, of course)

   Alternatively, start the registrar directly:
   ./registrar -asap=auto -asapannounce=auto -enrp=auto -enrpannounce=auto
   See also chapter D for registrar parameters.

5. Start at least one pool element
   ./poolelement-example
   (You can start multiple pool elements; they may also run on different hosts, of course.
    If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!)

6. Start a pool user
   ./pooluser-example
   (If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!)
   Now, you have to manually enter text lines on standard input.

7. If everything works, you can test RSerPool functionality by stopping the pool
   element and watching the failover.

8. You can monitor the status of each component using the Component Status Protocol
   client "cspclient". Simply start it by "./cspmonitor". It will listen for status
   messages sent via UDP on port 2960. The components (registrar, server, etc.) accept
   the command line arguments "-cspserver=<Server>:<Port>" and
   "-cspinterval=<Microseconds>". For example, if you want a status update every 300ms
   and your CSP client is listening on port 2960 of host 1.2.3.4, use the arguments
   "-cspserver=1.2.3.4:2960 -cspinterval=300".
   NOTE: You *must* specify address AND interval, otherwise no messages are sent.

9. You can use Wireshark (http://www.wireshark.org) to observe the RSerPool and demo
   protocol traffic. Coloring rules and filters can be found in the directory
   "rsplib/wireshark" Simply copy "colorfilters", "dfilters" and optionally
   "preferences" to ~/.wireshark (or /root/.wireshark).
   The "rsplib/wireshark" directory also includes the packet dissector souces for
   the demo protocols. These dissectors are already included in recent Wireshark
   distributions and are usually not needed!



B. DEMO POOL ELEMENTS (SERVERS)

All demo servers can be started using the ./server program. It takes a set of
common parameters as well as some service-specific arguments. These parameters
are explained in the following.

E. COMPONENT STATUS PROTOCOL

The Component Status Protocol is a simple UDP-based protocol for RSerPool
components to send their status to a central monitoring component. A
console-based receiver is ./cspmonitor; it receives the status updates by
default on UDP port 2960.

In order to send status information, the registrar as well as all servers and
clients described in section B provide two parameters:

-cspserver=Address:Port: Sets the CSP monitor server's address and port.

-cspinterval=Interval: Sets the interval for the CSP status updates in
                       milliseconds.

Note: Both parameters MUST be provided in order to send status updates!

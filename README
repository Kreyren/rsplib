How to set up a simple test of rsplib-0.8.0 using the unstable files:

1. Get latest sctplib1-****.tar.gz and install it by
   - unpacking the Tar/GZip archive
   - ./autgen.sh
      (invokes automake, calls ./configure with some parameters, calls make)
   . make install
      (as root!)

2. Get latest socketapi-****.tar.gz and install it by
   - unpacking the Tar/GZip archive
   - ./autgen.sh
      (invokes automake, calls ./configure with some parameters, calls make)
   . make install
      (as root!)

3. Get latest rsplib2-****.tar.gz and install it by
   - unpacking the Tar/GZip archive
   - ./autgen.sh
      (invokes automake, calls ./configure with some parameters, calls make)

4. Ensure that multicast is working!
   - You need a configured Ethernet interface to use multicast, even if you want to
     make tests only via loopback! Multicast does not work correctly otherwise,
     at least under Linux and Darwin.
     Alternative:
     If you have a dummy device, configure it and set a default route to it:
     root# ifconfig dummy0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.0.255 up
     root# route add default gw 10.0.0.2
   - Ensure that your firewall settings for the ethernet interface allow
     UDP packets from the nameserver (Server Announce).

5. Start at least one registrar
   ./registrar-example
   (You can start multiple registrars; they may also run on different hosts, of course)

6. Start at least one pool element
   ./poolelement-example
   (You can start multiple pool elements; they may also run on different hosts, of course.
    If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!)

6. Start a pool user
   ./pooluser-example -auto=250
   (If it complains about finding no registrar, check the multicast settings!
    -auto=250 sends a text string to the Echo PE every 250ms. If you do not set
    this parameter, you have to manually enter text lines at standard input.)

7. If everythink works, you can test RSerPool functionality by stopping the pool
   element and watching the failover. The example Echo service uses ASAP Cookies
   to store the line number.

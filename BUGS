- Deregistration:
The deregistration of a non-existing Pool Element fails: The
nameserver closes the connection and prints an error.
Reason: The current ASAP standard does not allow to return
a DEREGISTRATION_RESPONSE message, since this would require
the "Pool Element Parameter" of the non-existing pool element.
This requires update of the ASAP draft.

- Well-known port for nameserver is assumed to be 9999 for now.
You must use this port number for the nameserver if you want to
use multicast Server Hunt.

Description: RSerPool client/server API library for load distribution and server redundancy
 .
 Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) is the IETF's upcoming standard for a
 lightweight server pool and session management framework. It provides highly
 available pool management (that is registration handling and load
 distribution/balancing) by components called Registrar and a
 client-side/server-side API for accessing the service of a pool. The API is
 provided by this package.

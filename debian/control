Description: This implementation of the IETF Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool)
 architecture rsplib provides a session layer protocol framework for the
 development of high availability applications. This prototype contains an ASAP
 library, a registrar and example pool elements and pool users.
 .
 The Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) architecture which is currently under
 standardization by the IETF RSerPool WG is an overlay network framework to
 provide server replication and session failover capabilities to its
 applications. Server redundancy leads to load distribution and load balancing,
 which are also covered by RSerPool. But in strong contrast to  other solutions
 in the area of GRID and high-performance computing, the  fundamental property
 of RSerPool is to be "lightweight", i.e. it can be used on devices providing
 only meagre memory and CPU resources (e.g. embedded systems like
 telecommunications equipment or routers). This property restricts the RSerPool
 architecture to the management of only pools and sessions (no data
 synchronization, user management, etc.), but on the other hand makes a very
 efficient realization possible.

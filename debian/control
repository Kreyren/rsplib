Description: RSerPool client/server API library for load distribution and
 Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) is the IETF's standard (RFC 5351 to
 RFC 5356) for a lightweight server pool and session management framework.
 It provides highly available pool management (that is registration
 handling and load distribution/balancing) by components called Registrar
 and a client-side/server-side API for accessing the service of a pool.
 .
 The API library is provided by this package.

Description: RSerPool Registrar service
 Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) is the IETF's standard (RFC 5351 to
 RFC 5356) for a lightweight server pool and session management framework.
 It provides highly available pool management (that is registration
 handling and load distribution/balancing) by components called Registrar
 and a client-side/server-side API for accessing the service of a pool.
 .
 This package provides the registrar, which is the management component
 for RSerPool-based server pools. You need at least one registrar in a
 setup, but for redundancy reasons, you should have at least two.

Description: RSerPool client/server API library for session management
 Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) is the IETF's standard (RFC 5351 to
 RFC 5356) for a lightweight server pool and session management framework.
 It provides highly available pool management (that is registration
 handling and load distribution/balancing) by components called Registrar
 and a client-side/server-side API for accessing the service of a pool.
 .
 The API library is provided by this package.
